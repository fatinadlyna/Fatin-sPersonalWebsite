   <article class="grew">
   <p>Sometimes I do not know how to describe myself as I have many personalities and love accomplishing and experiencing many things. There are times when I'm quiet       and loud. It depends on the people that I met and the energy that they have. Other than that, I enjoy being alone too. I'm active and enjoy playing sports such         as badminton, football and more. Besides that, I'm a food lover and hunter. I've always treated myself to good food. My favorite is cakes that is red velvet cake       from Secret Recipe. I feel happy whenever I get cakes from other people.</p>
   <p>I grew up in Kelantan with my grandmother but moved to Selangor a few times and had my school changed a couple of times for some reason. My grandmother is a          lovely person and has raised me very well. Besides that, my parents stayed and worked in Selangor since I was a kid and was divorced when I was in secondary           school in Subang Jaya. Being the eldest sister is not an easy task and has taught me a lot. Other than that, studying in many schools has had me having so many         friends. I love to surround myself with great people who can help me be better and enjoy going out either alone or with other people. Last but not least, my           family always comes first over anything else. I'm grateful for all the things I have and striving for the best outcomes.</p>
