   <p id="fl">Adzimah</p>
   <p class="ds">SMK Mahmud is the place I did get to meet and know Adzimah and also is one of the best schools in my hometown. We were studied in the same classroom    and always together at that time. She is one of the beautiful souls I have ever met. She is very soft-spoken whenever she talks. She loves to encourage people to do    better. Despite the pain that she carries, she always gives the best in her work and others. We are still contacted with each other even we did not meet for years    and far from distance as she continued her studies in another state and lives in Kelantan.</p>

   <p id="fl">Nuraisyah</p>
   <p class="ds">She is Aisyah but in our group we called her Cik Mami. Aisyah is my close friend together with Amirah and Salmi. She is so beautiful and has very    flawless skin. She was one of the students who often got high marks in the form 6 examination along with Amirah and Salmi. She loves kids and always spends her time    with her niece. In the middle of the night, we would have a video call in a group to discuss or to accompany each other when we have something to get done.

   <p  id="fl">Amirah</p>
   <p class="ds">I met Amirah at form 6 school in Kelantan. At first, we were not even close as we are right now. We started to get close after we talked to each    other. She is a fun companion who always laughs at silly jokes. I never get bored talking to her especially when we study together through a video call. On top of    that, the good thing about studying together with her is that she always focuses rather than talking. She is very diligent in doing her task and would stay all    night to get it all done. Now she is one of my closest friends who always contacted me. Sometimes we would share our opinions and discuss them. Other than that, Her    father is Chinese and she can speak Chinese very well.</p>

   <p id="fl">Atiqah</p>
   <p class="ds">This is Atiqah. I met her in 2016 at her brother's birthday party then became close after several times of hanging out. She always treat me to good    food after she got her salary. Besides that, she was one of the people who cared the most when I was sick. Now she holds a part in my life as she is considered a    sister. She lives in Selangor but moved to Sabah two years ago if I'm not mistaken. Other than that, she just get married to a person that often makes her smile.    I'm happy for her and hope her marriage remains till jannah.</p>

   <p id="fl">Salmi</p>
   <p class="ds">Salmi is the quiet one among all of my close friends. She is very soft and polite. We rarely contacted each other as she infrequently on the phone.    However, we do reach each other at certain times. She always spends time at home and rarely hangs out with friends. Although she may seem quiet she is quite funny      when she is with her close friends.</p>
