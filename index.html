          <p class="words"> As a student of Bachelor of Information Science (Hons.) Library Management in UiTM Merbok. I believe that success comes from self               discipline as it helps students stay focused on their responsibilities. How we discipline ourselves includes managing our daily practices and time affecting            our future. Most students nowadays are lack discipline in handling their tasks that often result in failures. The more we discipline ourselves, the greater            the chance of success we get.</p>
          <p>A Concept of Success from an Islamic Point of View</p>
          <p class="words"> “This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah – Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and            spend out of what We have provided for them, And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed efore you,and of the            Hereafter they are certain [in faith]. Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.”
           [Surah Baqarah; 2:2-5].</p>

      <p class="words" align="right">Everything starts with ourselves and within ourselves. Apart from believing and being content with the provisions of destiny, we         should realize that we are the one who holds the responsibility for our life, every decision we make. Never blame other people for our unhappiness as the choice        is in our hands. We can always take a new step to make our lives different. There are always chances as long as we are still breathing. Don't give up <3</p>
